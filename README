OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Toradex Easy Installer
=======================================================

This layer is used to build the Toradex Easy Installer utility.
It provides a small distro called "tezi" along with image recipes
for the root file system and recipies for the Qt based UI.

Currently the Qt User Interface as well as the utility flash-wince
are not publicly available and stored on internal only git
repositories. In order to build an image one needs to remove those
two utilities from the image recipes.

This layer depends on:
